Instructions:
1. Copy the FASTA and GFF file you want to analyze into the this folder.
2. Edit the config file to have the correct fasta file, GFF file, motif sequence, match points, miss points, cutoff score, number of upstream nucleotides, start index, and end index. Start and end indices are optional.
3. Double click the start file depending on which operating system you are using.
4. After the window closes, Scores.csv will be generated
