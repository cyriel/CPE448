Lab 4:
parse the fasta file and create data like lab 3

Need to create:
   inIsoform(DNAFrag frag) in main class        // locates which isoform the sequence is in
   whichRecords(DNAFrag frag) in Isoform class  // returns which introns/exons the sequence is contained in.
   nucleoCompo(string dna) in main class        // nucleotide composition: num A/T/C/G
   skip() in main class                         //checks if a substring has n in it. return true if n is found, false otherwise
   genString() in main class                    // see ~/test.java for a working generator

output:
   nucleotide composition of repeated sequence
   coordinates of repeated sequence (start, stop)
   number of repeated sequences that occur
   display location of repeated sequence (intergenic, gene[intron/exon])
      if in intron/exon, report what number the intron/exon is in the list
      // go through the exon array list. If we pass the repeated sequence, it's in an intron at the number of the increment (for bio purposes)
      // If we find the repeated sequence in an exon, it's the number of the increment + 1 (for bio purposes)
      // if the repeated sequence starts before an exon value, but goes through or ends in an exon, report intron, exon, and possible followings
      // we would need a start and stop boolean to facilitate accurate searching. start is when we find the proper start location and we push values into a return array list. stop is when we find the proper stop location and we finish the search and return the array list.
      // the arraylist should contain strings as "[intron|exon] #"
