Instructions:
1. Copy the FASTA you want to analyze into the this folder.
2. Edit the config file to have the correct fasta file, sequence size, start index*, and end index*. Start and end are optional.
3. Double click the start file depending on which operating system you are using.
4. After the window closes, output.txt and output.csv will be generated


Config File description:

Note: You must have the Java JRE installed to run this program. If running the program doesn't work, you need to download and install Java. The java download link can be found here: https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

*Note: Please realize that the limitation of this program is a range of 1245 nucleotides
         This can be verified by the math equation: end index - start index < 1245
